There are two types of Intent, explicit and implicit, explicit being the more secure of the two.
Both SecondFragment.kt and ThirdFragment.kt are explici, however SecondFragment.kt is flawed.

SecondFragment.kt originally included:

                        var intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)

Which is replaced by:

                        var intent = Intent(activity, ProductScrollingActivity::class.java)

Now a user may activatate all activites.
