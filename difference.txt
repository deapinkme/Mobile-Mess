There are two types of Intent, explicit and implicit, explicit being the more secure of the two.
Both SecondFragment.kt and ThirdFragment.kt are explici, however SecondFragment.kt is flawed.

SecondFragment.kt is modified to include:

                        var intent = Intent(activity, ProductScrollingActivity::class.java)
compared to:
                        var intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)

Now a user may activatate all activites.
